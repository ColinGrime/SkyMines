#┃ TECHNICAL NOTE:                                                                          ┃
#┃                                                                                          ┃
#┃ A "default" mine isn't strictly required. However, in the case that a player has either: ┃
#┃   1. A token that has the "skymine" NBT tag without a "skymine-identifier" NBT tag.      ┃
#┃   2. An already placed down mine that has no data from the "identifier" DB column.       ┃
#┃ Then, the default mine below will be used in its place.                                  ┃
#┃ The above cases should only happen if you are migrating from SkyMines v1.                ┃
#┃                                                                                          ┃
#┃ This means that the default mine will NOT be used if an invalid identifier is attached   ┃
#┃ to a token or saved in the database. I make no assumptions that you actually wanted to   ┃
#┃ delete an existing mine path or that a non-existing identifier was somehow saved to the  ┃
#┃ database. In any of these cases, it doesn't make sense to permanently convert a player's ┃
#┃ mine to the default path. Instead, a warning message will be sent to the player telling  ┃
#┃ them that the mine identifier does not exist (the message will contain the identifier).  ┃
#┃ In addition, the mine will be disabled and can only be picked up.                        ┃
#┃                                                                                          ┃
#┃ Once you add back in a valid mine above with the same identifier from the warning        ┃
#┃ message, the token/mine will start working again. This technically means it's possible   ┃
#┃ to disable entire mines by deleting its path, but this wasn't the intended behavior! :)  ┃
#┃                                                                                          ┃
