# By default, all upgrades are available to players.                               #
#                                                                                  #
# Want to require permission to upgrade a mine? Simply negative the permission.    #
# -> ex. the whole type: "-skymines.upgrades.composition"                          #
# -> ex. a specific level: "-skymines.upgrades.composition.2"                      #
#                                                                                  #
# ^ After negating permission, the player can no longer upgrade the mine until     #
# you remove the negation or add the "skymines.upgrades.composition.2" permission. #

# Below, you can define unique paths for each upgrade type.                        #
